# Vinyl Viewer

## Abstract
For this project we were tasked to collaborate to create a react app using TypeScript. We had to first find an API to use and design the component layout and HTML wireframe. We decided to create a react app that pulls from [Last Fm](last.fm) public API. Once we had our design we had to teach ourselves typescript and implement it in this react app. The overarching goal was to create the feeling of flipping through vinyl records at a record store. A user can browse a list of artist and see their albums. They can then click on that album to see more details where they can then save it, once saved they can view their collection and even remove those albums from the user collection.

## Project Goals and Objectives
