# Vinyl Viewer

### [Deployed Project](https://vinylviewer.netlify.app/)

## Abstract

Vinyl Viewer is a TypeScript/React application designed to emulate the record-collecting experience. A user can search for their favorite artist, then browse their associated albums. They can then select an album to see more details, where they can then save it to their collection. From the user's collection view, albums can be viewed, filtered by artist or album name, or removed from their collection.

For this project we were tasked to collaborate to create a React app using TypeScript. We had to first find an API to use and design the component layout and HTML wireframe. We decided to create a React app that pulls from [Last Fm](last.fm) public API. Once we had our design, we had to teach ourselves TypeScript and implement it in this React app. The overarching goal was to create the feeling of flipping through vinyl records at a record store.
